# Nutritional website

This site is a remake of the Dad Bod Destroyer Stack website. I chose to remake this site because it had plenty of opportunities to apply Bootstrap, and make this project very dynamic while also having a lot of details to apply with CSS. This site also allowed me to reuse my markup so I can apply CSS properties to several different sections and keep the CSS minimal.
